# SCHIFFRE 86 PCB
A (PCB for a) FRL Compact 1800-style board (i.e. Cypher) with 86 keys.
Desiged with flex cuts, and to be used floating, with a gasket mounted plate (see schiffre_86_plate).

Schiffre 86 is a *shield* PCB, without its own MCU.
See schiffre_nrf for a bluetooth powered host board, that can be attached using a Flexible Flat Cable (FFC) based interconnect.

## Layouts
There is an emphasis on providing several bottom row layout options, including a 2x3u split spacebar.
See the [KLE file](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/19b67d0e8a5331e922c6eb11a3dd6522) for more details on the supported options.

## Credits
Initial inspiration for the setup was based on [westfoxtrot's cypher_pcb](https://github.com/westfoxtrot/cypher_pcb) (although it's heavily modified since).
