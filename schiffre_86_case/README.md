# SCHIFFRE 86 CASE

A case for the Schiffre 86, housing the schiffre host board (schiffre_nrf), shield PCB (schiffre_86), and switch plate (schiffre_86_plate).

## 3D Printing
Top and Bottom case require a 400mm wide build area.  The main challenge when printing is the top case, which is more prone to warping due to it's geometry.
I've had better results with PETG (Overture PETG) than with PLA. I have yet to try ABS (a heated enclosure will be required).
Prototype was printed using a .6mm nozzle, .15mm layer height, 3 perimeters, 4-5 top/bottom layers, 50% cubic infill.

I've printed the gaskets and feet using Recreus Filaflex 82A TPU.
